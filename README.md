# The Tic-Tac-Toe
>The purpose of this project was to demonstrate our learned skills on Ruby programming. Here we developed the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

<img src="screenshot/screen.png">

In this project we created an executable file on main.rb that allows the users to play the game through terminal

## How To Play

"Tic Tac Toe" is a 2 player game which includes 9 squares each of them represented with a number. Each player will be represented with a symbol ("X" or "O") and their respective symbols will overwrite the square numbers.The first player will start the game.
If after 9 turns neither player manages to put their respective symbols in a straight/diagonal line the game will end as a draw

## Build with

- Ruby
- VSCode
- Rubocop

2. Navigate to the downloaded file and click bin folder than main.rb (./bin/main.rb) or you can do this through the terminal "cd Tic-Tac-Toe-Game"

3. Type in ruby bin/main.rb in the terminal.

4. After the 3 step the game will start first by asking the two players names.
