## How To Play

"Tic Tac Toe" is 2 player game which includes 9 squares each of them represented with a number. Each player will be represented with a symbol ("X" or "O") and their respective symbols will overwrite the square numbers. The starter of the game will be the first player.
In case none of the players manages to put three of their symbols in a straight line or in a diagonal line the game will be end on draw.
